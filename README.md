# Gin-Rummy-Investigation
This is all for an Math IB project that I did some programming for, and all of these scripts are for devolping some data about Gin Rummy

For rules on Gin Rummy, see: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/gin-rummy/
This program is probably not super omptimized, but feel free to use any of it if you do need it

This program was used it order to get the average value of a Gin Rummy hand by running millions of hands and determining the points in each one, and running
a simple analysis on it for a school project. The method used to pair the cards is something I came up with, and went through a couple of runthroughs to get it
working properly, and to account for some fringe cases. For more clarification on exactly how the program works, code is extensively commented
